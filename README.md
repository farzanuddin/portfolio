# Portfolio - Personal Website

Welcome to the debut version of my professional portfolio, designed to showcase my evolving projects and provide accessible contact information.

## Technologies Utilized

- **Next.js**: A robust React framework, facilitating the creation of server-rendered, statically generated, and hybrid web applications.
- **React**: A versatile JavaScript library for crafting user interfaces.
- **ESLint**: A pluggable and customizable linting utility, ensuring code quality for JavaScript and JSX.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter, contributing to a uniform and consistent code style.

## Project Initialization

This project was kickstarted using the JavaScript template of `Next.js` through the `npx create-next-app@latest` command. The application, currently running on `Next.js` version 13, stands as a testament to the power and flexibility of the framework.

## Styling Approach

The application's aesthetics are achieved through the use of `CSS Modules`, enabling scoped CSS for each component and mitigating the risk of CSS class name collisions.

## Code Formatting and Linting

To maintain a clean and standardized codebase, the project undergoes formatting with `prettier` and thorough linting with `ESLint`. The configuration includes the `react` and `prettier` plugins for comprehensive code analysis.
