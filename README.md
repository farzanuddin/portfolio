# Portfolio - Personal Website

This is the first version of my professional career portfolio where I can showcase my projects as I
make them, as well as provide access on ways to contact me.

## Technologies Used

- `Next.js`: A powerful React framework for building server-rendered, statically generated, and
  hybrid web applications.
- `React`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `ESLint`: A pluggable and customizable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX code.
- `Prettier`: An opinionated code formatter to maintain consistent code style.

This project was boostrapped using `Next.js` with the Javascript template. Initialized by using the
`npx create-next-app@latest` command. The application is running on `Next.js` version 13.

The application is styled using `CSS Modules`, which allows the CSS to be scoped to the component it
is used in and avoid CSS class name collisions.

The project is formatted using `prettier` and is linted with `ESLint` using `react` and `prettier`
plugins.
